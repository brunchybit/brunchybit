### Hi, nice to meet ya ðŸ‘‹

I am a DevOps / Platform / SRE / Cloud Engineer who loves to solve tough problems at scale. 

Stuff I love to work on:
- Performant, scalable solutions
- Meaningful observability
- Security Engineering
- Automating tedious, unnecessary, and error prone tasks. 
- Developing data driven decisions on cloud spend and rightsizing of cloud resources
- Deep dives into Kubernetes and all relevant esoterica
- Stress, soak, smoke, performance, and chaos testing
- PostgreSQL High Availability and Scale

### Work

I am currently a Principal Engineer at [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) working on platform and infrastructure for their Digital Asset Management solution, Brandfolder.

Before that, I worked at [testdouble](https://testdouble.com) as their Lead DevOps consultant / Director of Infrastructure Services.

I also worked at [cloudability](https://www.apptio.com/products/cloudability/), albeit prior to their acquisition by Apptio. 

I was the first full time software engineer hired at [ello.co](https://waxy.org/2024/01/the-quiet-death-of-ellos-big-dreams/). Fun times.

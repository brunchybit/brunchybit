### Hi, nice to meet ya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a punk rock kid turned SRE / DevOps practitioner.

Stuff I love: 
- Solving tough problems at large scale
- InfoSec and DevSecOps
- Automating tedious, unnecessary, and error prone tasks. 
- Data driven decisions on cloud spend and rightsizing of cloud resources
- Deep dives into containerization, kubernetes
- Stress, soak, smoke, performance, and chaos testing
- PostgreSQL High Availability and Scale

### Work

I am currently a Staff Platform Engineer at [brandfolder](https://brandfolder.com).
Formerly, I worked at [testdouble](https://testdouble.com) as their Lead DevOps consultant / Director of Infrastructure Services
I also worked at [cloudability](https://www.apptio.com/products/cloudability/), albeit prior to their acquisition by Apptio. 
I was the first full time software engineer hire at [ello.co](https://ello.co/), which was a total blast.


### What I'm working on

- InfoSec
- Kubernetes
- Tuning / Stress Testing and Measuring PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud Platform

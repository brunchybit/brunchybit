### Hi, nice to meet ya ðŸ‘‹

I'm a punk rock kid turned SRE / DevOps practitioner.

Stuff I love: 
- Sovling tough problems at large scale
- Automating tedious, unnecessary, and error prone tasks. 
- Data driven decisions on cloud spend and rightsizing of cloud resources
- Deep dives into containerization, kubernetes
- Stress, soak, smoke, performance, and chaos testing

### Work

I am currently a Senior Platform Engineer at [brandfolder](https://brandfolder.com).
Formerly, I worked at [testdouble](https://testdouble.com) as their Lead DevOps consultant. 
I also worked at [cloudability](https://www.apptio.com/products/cloudability/), albeit prior to their acquisition by Apptio. 
I was the first full time software engineer hire at [ello.co](https://ello.co/), which was a total blast.
